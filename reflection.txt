What made it easier for you to implement the view?

     The visual editor for the layouts made it easier for
   me to be able to configure a view however I wanted with
   a relatively easy to understand interface.


What made it difficult for you to implement the view?

     What made it difficult for me to implement the view is
   the lack of experience that I currently possess about 
   programming in Kotlin. It took me while to understand the
   INTENT managing part. I look forward to further expand on
   my understanding of the Kotlin methods.
